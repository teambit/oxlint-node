# Oxc Scope

Welcome to the **Oxc Scope**, a dedicated space for tools built around the [Oxc](https://oxc.rs/) project. This scope focuses on providing a set of Node.js wrappers around Oxc tools, enabling seamless integration of Oxc functionalities in JavaScript/TypeScript projects.

## Purpose

The Oxc Scope provides:

- **Node.js Wrappers**: Node.js wrappers around Oxc tools to allow their usage in JavaScript/TypeScript environments.
- **Bit Services Integration**: Usage examples of Bit services that utilize these Node.js wrappers.
- **Bit Dev Environments**: Custom Bit development environments leveraging Oxc tools to enhance developer workflows.

At the moment, this scope contains an end-to-end example of the **Oxlinter**, a Rust-based linter, wrapped for Node.js and integrated into Bit services.

## Features

- üì¶ **Node.js Wrappers**: Use Oxc tools like Oxlint directly in your Node.js projects.
- üîß **Bit Services**: Leverage Bit services and components built around these Node.js wrappers for seamless integration.
- üåê **Bit Dev Environments**: Custom Bit development environments to improve your component-driven development experience.

## Scope Structure

Here‚Äôs an overview of the current Scope structure:

### [linter/oxlint-node](https://bit.cloud/teambit/oxc/linter/oxlint-node)

A Node.js wrapper for Oxlint. It allows Node.js applications to leverage Oxlint's powerful linting capabilities. This wrapper abstracts the Rust-based Oxlint, providing a simple interface for usage in JavaScript/TypeScript environments.

### [linter/oxlint-linter]((https://bit.cloud/teambit/oxc/linter/oxlint-linter))

A Bit linter built on top of the `oxlint-node` wrapper. It serves as both a utility and an example for how to integrate Oxlint with Bit for component-based development. Developers can use this linter to validate code quality for their Bit components.

### [examples/envs/oxlint-env](https://bit.cloud/teambit/oxc/examples/envs/oxlint-env)

An environment setup that uses the `oxlint-linter`. This environment allows developers to run linting on Bit components in their projects. It's a practical example demonstrating how to integrate Oxlint and ensure linting in a Bit-based development workflow.

## Future Plans

This scope is continuously evolving, with plans to add more Oxc tools and their respective Node.js wrappers. The aim is to make it easy for JavaScript/TypeScript developers to integrate these high-performance tools into their workflows.

---

A bit linter that uses the `oxlint` binary to lint Bit components.

This module is a utility and an example for how to integrate Oxlint with Bit for component-based development.

It uses the [oxlint-node](https://bit.cloud/teambit/oxc/linter/oxlint-node) module to run the linting process.

See [bit.cloud/teambit/oxc/examples/envs/oxlint-env](https://bit.cloud/teambit/oxc/examples/envs/oxlint-env) for an example of how to use this module in a Bit environment.
